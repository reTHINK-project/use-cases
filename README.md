# WP1 Use-cases and Business Models
WP1 aims to examine the impact of the concepts developed by reTHINK project on todayâ€™s ecosystems for communication and services/content delivery and how they might be transformed in the future: who are the players now and who participates in the future; what impact does a concept such as reTHINK have on the economics and the society in the EU?
The reTHINK project addresses use-cases and business models in one work package. Because usage scenarios and use-cases will show and describe how the user experiences the reTHINK architecture and concepts. The use-cases will be evaluated by their business relevance and thus are used to derive requirements to the reTHINK architecture. They will be chosen and used to be demonstrated in the WP5
