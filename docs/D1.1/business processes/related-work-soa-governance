OpenGroup provides a SOA Governance Framework technical standard that defines a model to be used by organisations to manage services lifecycle according to SOA principles. 
It consists of an SOA Governance Reference Model (SGRM) which is utilized as a starting point, and an SOA Governance Vitality Method (SGVM) which is a definition/improvement feedback process to define a focused and customized SOA Governance Regimen.

The SGRM defines a number of constituent parts, including:
- SOA governance guiding principles to assist in the prioritization and decision-making for the design, deployment, and execution of the SOA Governance Regimen. This includes aspects of people/roles, processes, and technology.
- SOA governing processes that realize the governance intentions of the organization
- Governed SOA processes
- SOA governance process artifacts
- SOA governance roles and responsibilities
- SOA governance technology
