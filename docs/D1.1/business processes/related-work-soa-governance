OpenGroup provides a SOA Governance Framework technical standard that defines a model to be used by organisations to manage services lifecycle according to SOA principles. 
It consists of an SOA Governance Reference Model (SGRM) which is utilized as a starting point, and an SOA Governance Vitality Method (SGVM) which is a definition/improvement feedback process to define a focused and customized SOA Governance Regimen.

The SGRM defines a SOA Service LifecycleManagement covering the design, development, deployment, management, and ultimate retirement of services.

Identified Key issues are:

- Establishing and approving service contracts (e.g., business processes will have the necessary capacity)
- Publishing services to enable re-use
- Managing multiple versions of a service
- Detecting unexpected service usage
- Meeting SLAs and architecting to enable this
- Managing to policies

More detailed Service Lifecycle Management activities are described including (http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/gov/procacts.htm#soa_governed_proc):
-Service Definition
-Service Realization Planning
-Service Modeling
-Service Implementation, Assembly, or Acquisition
-Service Testing
-Service Deployment
-Service Management and Monitoring
-Service Support

In addition all information used by The Open Group SOA Governance Framework is described at (http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/gov/procinfo.htm#info_entities) notably Service Description in terms of (just mention the ones more relevant to reTHINK):
