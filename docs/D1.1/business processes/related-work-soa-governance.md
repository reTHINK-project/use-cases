OpenGroup provides a SOA Governance Framework technical standard that defines a model to be used by organisations to manage services lifecycle according to SOA principles. 
OpenGroup SOA Service LifecycleManagement covers the design, development, deployment, management, and ultimate retirement of services. Identified Key issues are:

- Establishing and approving service contracts (e.g., business processes will have the necessary capacity)
- Publishing services to enable re-use
- Managing multiple versions of a service
- Detecting unexpected service usage
- Meeting SLAs and architecting to enable this
- Managing to policies

More detailed Service Lifecycle Management activities are described including (http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/gov/procacts.htm#soa_governed_proc):

* Service Definition
* Service Realization Planning
* Service Modeling
* Service Implementation, Assembly, or Acquisition
* Service Testing
* Service Deployment
* Service Management and Monitoring
* Service Support

In addition all information used by The Open Group SOA Governance Framework is described (http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/gov/procinfo.htm#info_entities) notably Service Description in terms of (just mention the ones more relevant to reTHINK):
* Service Contract
* Service Performance Reports
* Service Requirements
* Service Ownership
* Service Classification
* Service Identity
* Service Performance Feedback
* Service Test Results
* Service Metrics
* Service Processes
* Service Characteristics
* Service Definition
* Service Interface Design Model
* Service Policy
* Implemented Service

OpenGroup SOA Governance standard provides an abstract but useful model that reTHINK may apply to instantiate a workable  Hyperty Governance model.
