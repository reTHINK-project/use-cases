The TM Forum eTOM standard provides common definitions to describe business activities to be performed by service providers including basic information required to perform each process element within a business activity. eTOM has been widely adopted by the Telecommunication industry 

 *picture of eTOM Level 0 Processes*
 
*to be sumarised:* Picture above, shows the highest conceptual view of the Business Process Framework. This view provides an overall context that differentiates strategy and lifecycle processes from the operations processes in two large process areas or categories, seen as the two major boxes in the upper part of the diagram. It also differentiates the key functional areas as horizontal layers across these process areas. The third major process area, concerned with management of the enterprise itself, is shown as a separate box in the lower part of the diagram. In addition also shows the internal and external entities that interact with the enterprise (as ovals).

At the overall conceptual level, the Business Process Framework can be viewed as having three major process areas, as shown in Figure 2 1
o	Strategy, Infrastructure & Product - covering planning and lifecycle management (associated with development and delivery)
o	Operations - covering the core of operational management 
o	Enterprise Management - covering corporate or business support management.
