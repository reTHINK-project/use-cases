The Business Collaboration Activities focus on the phases "Partner", "Operate" and "Monetise". They influence the phases "Design" and "Integration". They are mostly concerned with:
* identifying Partners
* defining roles, business rules and policies
* defining business contractual, financial and operational models collectively known as partnership models which identify touch points/ APIs for the processes operated between partners.

Business collaboration activities are requiered for:
* setting up a partnership agreement for the first time
* adding or changing partners, processes, technical specifications and business rules
* adding new functional services/ products to be delivered by or uses within the partnership
 
The Technical Collaboration activities focus on and are accountable and responsible for the "Design" and "Integration" phases.These phases use the partnering agreements from the business collaboration activities to select and configure reusable components solutions to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements set by the business collaboration partnering requirements (e.g. touch points).

There are three distinct areas where agreements are needed:
* Functional Service Integration Model - for services and networks that are used to deliver the end user service and the intermediate enabling functional services
* Business Collaboration Model - describes how each party works commercially, financially and operationally with oder partners
* Technical Collaboration Model - captures the IT aspects of the collaboration and is focused on IT, BSS, OSS, management interfaces and APIs
