The TM Forum provides a framework to manage the Partnership and Service Life Cycles for B2B2X-Partnerships. With PaDIOM it adresses both business and technical considerations. PaDIOM stands for the five stages
* Partnering
* Design
* Implementaion
* Operation
* Monetize

# Business Collaboration

The Business Collaboration Activities focus on the phases "Partner", "Operate" and "Monetise". They influence the phases "Design" and "Integration" and are mostly concerned with:
* identifying Partners
* defining roles, business rules and policies
* defining business contractual, financial and operational models collectively known as partnership models which identify touch points/ APIs for the processes operated between partners.

Business collaboration activities are requiered for:
* setting up a partnership agreement for the first time
* adding or changing partners, processes, technical specifications and business rules
* adding new functional services/ products to be delivered by or uses within the partnership
 
#### Business Model Selection
The Business Model Selection describes the business role(s) each partner will play in providing the business value. Each Service Provider has a clear role in the value chain based on their core capabilities and strengths and their alignment to the other members in the chain. The roles are also used to describe the management relationships. The Business Model furthermore describes how the partners provide the functional servcies and the key business relationships between their functional roles.
The three digital service lifecycle stages are:
* Onboarding - where to get the partners from (internal, external, federated, syndicated ...)
* Adding Value - configuration, branding, packaging/ bundling, interfaces, commercialization
* Delivering - directly, indirectly

Business Rules define how ech partner will behave with resprecth to each other partner.
Whilst business rules may be identified as part of the business model, technically these must be implemented in many different component parts of the service and a common product/ service catalogue/ policy server.
Business rules will include:
* Business Model - Branding, Service Levels, Service configuration, geographic rules, service applicapility rules
* Contractual Model - Penalties
* Financial Model - Pricing/ Discounting and other commercial terms
* Operational Model - Metrics to be collected and used for operations management and governance

#### Contract Model Selection

Here the joint commercial goals and the partnership terms and conditions are agreed upon.
Contractual models can be summarized in three main types:
* integrate
* distribute
* co-sell

#### Financial Model Selection

The financial model selection identifies the financial management options between partners on how to share revenues and to manage the cash flow through the value chain.
Either the partners send/ receive settlements directly based on the contracutal model, or the partner sends/ receives an invoice.

#### Operating Model Selection

# Technical Collaboration

The Technical Collaboration activities focus on and are accountable and responsible for the "Design" and "Integration" phases.These phases use the partnering agreements from the business collaboration activities to select and configure reusable components solutions to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements set by the business collaboration partnering requirements (e.g. touch points).

There are three distinct areas where agreements are needed:
* Functional Service Integration Model - for services and networks that are used to deliver the end user service and the intermediate enabling functional services
* Business Collaboration Model - describes how each party works commercially, financially and operationally with oder partners
* Technical Collaboration Model - captures the IT aspects of the collaboration and is focused on IT, BSS, OSS, management interfaces and APIs
