# Business Collaboration

The Business Collaboration Activities focus on the phases "Partner", "Operate" and "Monetise". They influence the phases "Design" and "Integration". They are mostly concerned with:
* identifying Partners
* defining roles, business rules and policies
* defining business contractual, financial and operational models collectively known as partnership models which identify touch points/ APIs for the processes operated between partners.

Business collaboration activities are requiered for:
* setting up a partnership agreement for the first time
* adding or changing partners, processes, technical specifications and business rules
* adding new functional services/ products to be delivered by or uses within the partnership
 
#### Business Model Selection
The Business Model selected describes the business role(s) each partner will play in providing the business value. Each Service Provider has a clear role in the value chain based on their core capabilities and strengths and their alignment to the other members in the chain. The roles are also used to describe the management relationships. The Business Model furthermore describes how the partners provide the fuctional servcies and the key busienss relationships between their fucthonal roles.
The three digital service lifecycle stages are:
* Onboarding
* Adding Value
* Delivering

# Technical Collaboration

The Technical Collaboration activities focus on and are accountable and responsible for the "Design" and "Integration" phases.These phases use the partnering agreements from the business collaboration activities to select and configure reusable components solutions to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements set by the business collaboration partnering requirements (e.g. touch points).

There are three distinct areas where agreements are needed:
* Functional Service Integration Model - for services and networks that are used to deliver the end user service and the intermediate enabling functional services
* Business Collaboration Model - describes how each party works commercially, financially and operationally with oder partners
* Technical Collaboration Model - captures the IT aspects of the collaboration and is focused on IT, BSS, OSS, management interfaces and APIs
