#### Brokerage Business Model

A Business Broker facilitates and promotes the best match between Service Consumers and Service Providers, orchestrating service delivery flows among them. In addition it also mediates business transactions between involved stakeholders.
The Business Broker should ensure it has access to a large consumer base in order to atract service providers. The main Business Flows are (see picture below):
- Service Providers publishes their offers towards the Business Broker
- Consumer searches for services or is notified by business broker about services that match consumer needs
- service delivery is managed by Business Broker but the main service delivery flow can be a direct flow between Service Provider and service consumer
- payments for service delivery are mediated by the Business Broker


Note: it should also be possible to have service / App providers having access to niche markets to trigger the service deliver through the collaborative service delivery ecosystem. FFS
