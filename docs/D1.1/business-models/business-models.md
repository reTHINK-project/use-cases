##### Collaborative Ecosystems

Ecosystem economics describe how the core product (e.g., iDevices or Google ads) becomes more and more valuable, as the
numbers of developers and users around it grow. Ecosystem economics are driven by network effects and lock-in. Apps attract  users, who in turn attract more developers, who make more apps, which attract even more users, and so on. This network effect between developers and users drives the explosive growth of the core product e.g. a mobile device or advertisement. Lock-in creates natural “walled gardens,” as users develop habits around apps, while developers are locked-in by high switching costs created by their investments into the core product. Deveopers must be viewed as partners, not as a source of direct profit. In general, ecosystem partners should also be seen as resellers that will push service provider services, to new users, new usage models and new market niches. 

Ecosystem partners share costs and risks of entrepreneurship, each one investing in the ecosystem, subsidizing the expansion of the overall business. Service Provider APIs are key technology enablers to promote and convince developers to be partners in the ecosystem. The business models of service provider APIs need to be aligned with the business models of developers.

Key ingredients to create ecosystems:

1. Software foundations: a rich set of APIs with managed fragmentation and a toolset for creating apps
2. Community of developers writing to the same set of APIs to spur innovation and cater to diverse use cases
3. Distribution (reach) across handsets, operators and regions
4. A means of monetization, such as ads or micropayments
5. A means of retailing content (discovery, promotion, search and social)

In terms of Software foudations, HTML5 is usually Pitched as a killer of platform walled gardens (e.g. Android and iOS), but stills needs lot of work before it competes with such platforms, notably in terms of the last 3 ingredients: distribution, monetization and retailing.

##### Asymmetric Business Models

According to VisionMobile research, Asymmetric business models are based on providing Products to different Markets in a way that promote the migration of profits from one market to another, breaking barriers between Industry barriers to get competitive advantage. The decision to compete in multiple markets should be driven by customer experience improvement, rather than about the efficiency of the company operations, by leveraging systems integration across industries. Customer traction in one market also boosts the demand in the other market. For example, smartphones get more attractive depending on how many apps and services are available on them. These markets are called Complementary Markets.
The mechanics of Asymmetric business models is based on promoting very high demand on complementary markets (e.g. by making products radically cheaper or more accessible for customers) and bundling Service Provider Core product with this new demand. The source of such demand should be difficult to replicate and to be bought by competitors. Then, Service Bundles should be created in a way that promotes the transfer of profits to Service Provider core business. Low (or zero) marginal cost of many modern technology products enables asymmetric business models to be self-sustained. 

Examples on how these models are applied by leading digital service providers are:

1. Apple competes in both consumer electronics and digital content markets, making consumer electronics more attractive.
2. Google that compete in both online advertising and mobile markets, leverages the integration of user data mining on Android with its advertising network to make Google PC ads more attractive for advertisers.
3. Amazon that compete in both e-commerce and tablet markets, takes advantage of its ability to present its services to tablet users to make online shopping easier and more spontaneous.

New generation of Messaging Service providers like WeChat, Viber, Line and others are also using asymmetric business models, by providing for free SMS competitor messaging services that is monetised with e-commerce services to sell digital goods, physical goods and services.

#### Brokerage Business Model

A Business Broker facilitates and promotes the best match between Service Consumers and Service Providers, orchestrating service delivery flows among them. In addition it also mediates business transactions between involved stakeholders.
The Business Broker should ensure it has access to a large consumer base in order to atract service providers. The main Business Flows are (see picture below):
- Service Providers publishes their offers towards the Business Broker
- Consumer searches for services or is notified by business broker about services that match consumer needs
- service delivery is managed by Business Broker but the main service delivery flow can be a direct flow between Service Provider and service consumer
- payments for service delivery are mediated by the Business Broker


Note: it should also be possible to have service / App providers having access to niche markets to trigger the service deliver through the collaborative service delivery ecosystem. FFS
