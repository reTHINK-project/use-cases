#### Identity Service Provider (to be adapted, source: [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_provider) )

An Identity Service Provider (IdP) is as a kind of service provider that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for service consumers and provides consumer authentication to other service providers, such as with web browser profiles responsible for:
(a) providing identifiers for consumers looking to interact with a system, and 
(b) asserting to such a system that such an identifier presented by a consumer is known to the provider, and 
(c) possibly providing other information about consumer user that is known to the provider. 

This may be achieved via an authentication service which verifies a security token that can be accepted as an alternative to repeatedly explicitly authenticating a user within a security realm.

An example of this could be where a website allows consumers to log in with Facebook credentials and Facebook acts as an identity provider. Facebook verifies that the user is an authorized user and returns information to the website - e.g. username and email address (specific details might vary). 
Similarly, if a site allows login with Google or Twitter credentials then Google and Twitter act as identity providers.

In perimeter authentication, a consumer needs to be authenticated only once (single sign-on). The consumer obtains a security token which is then validated by an Identity Assertion Provider for each system that the consumer needs to access.

#### Identified Service Consumer

A service consumer that is identified by a Identity Service Provider.

#### Anonymous Service Consumer

A service consumer that is not identified.

#### Communication Service Provider (CSP)

A Service Provider that manages the delivery of Communication services e.g. telephony, chat, to Communication Service Consumers. NSP and CSP roles can be played by the same Service Provider actor.

#### Conversation / Communication Participant

The Participant that organise and invites other consumers to participate in conversations are called Organisers or (Owners?).

#### Network Service Provider

Network service providers may consist of telecommunications companies, data carriers, wireless communications providers, Internet service providers, and cable television operators offering high-speed Internet access.
