### Actors

Alice and Bob manages a set of devices from different vendors. 

Note: Alice and Bob can be organisations or individuals.
### Pre-conditions:

[Devices are registered with their domains](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/use-cases/blob/master/docs/M2M%20Always%20Connected%20in%20Trustful%20Domains%20for%20Multi%20vendor%20devices.md).

The domains have a strong trustful relationship implicitly or explicitly set (we should have a separated Use Case to describe how trust between domains can be set)
### Description

1- Bob's device discovers Alice's device and asks permission to connect to it.

2- Trust between Alice and Bob domain is evaluated.

3- In case Trust is high, permission is given.

4- Bob's device connects with Alice's device.

Example: Public Health Care Service: Individual wearable devices are seamless connected to public healthcare devices.
### Differentiation â€“ market relevance

Currently, there is no standard mechanism to enable p2p adhoc connections between "smart devices".
