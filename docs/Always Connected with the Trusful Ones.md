### Actors

Alice and Bob are [Identified Consumer](../blob/master/docs/D1.1/business-models/business-roles.md#identified-service-consumer) that are [Conversation Participants](../blob/master/docs/D1.1/business-models/business-roles.md#conversation--communication-participant)

Alice and Bob are subscribers of [Communication Service Providers](../blob/master/docs/D1.1/business-models/business-roles.md#communication-service-provider-csp).
### Pre-conditions:
- #81  #83 Alice and Bob are registered in their CSPs.
- Alice and Bob trust each other e.g. they are married -> _TODO: link to trust management Use Cases?_
- Alice and Bob context are published and known by each other _TODO: link to human context management_
### Description

Trustful Humans can directly talk and share images or other digital resources (photos) each other with no need to perform the usual call setup procedure (invite, ring, accept).
- Alice checks Bob is available for talk, including some images from him captured a minute ago confirms he is having lunch alone
- Alice pushes a "talk and video" button and says "Hi Bob, pls don't forget to pick up the kids today from school"
- Bob immediately listens to what Alice said and watches her image in his screen. Pushes a "join" button and have a short conversation with her.
#### Inter-domain

This use case is valid in case Alice and Bob are subscribers of different CSPs.
#### Variant 1

_to be discussed_ Trust can be unidirectional e.g. Alice is Bob's boss and only Alice can directly talk with Bob but Bob can not directly talk with Alice.
### Differentiation â€“ market relevance

Currently the call setup procedure is always the same and it does not take into account the level of trust between involved parties.
