Bob is [Identified Consumer](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/use-cases/blob/master/docs/D1.1/business-models/business-roles.md#identified-service-consumer) that is a [Conversation Participant](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/use-cases/blob/master/docs/D1.1/business-models/business-roles.md#conversation--communication-participant)

Alice and Bob are subscribers of the same [Communication Service Provider](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/use-cases/blob/master/docs/D1.1/business-models/business-roles.md#communication-service-provider-csp) but each one use identities managed by different [Identity Service Providers](../blob/master/docs/D1.1/business-models/business-roles.md#identity-service-provider)
